# SQL Practice Database

This is a **work-in-progress** open-source SQL practice project.  

## What This Project Will Include

- **Database schema:** Tables for departments, employees, products, customers, orders, and more.
- **Sample data:** Realistic data for all tables.
- **Practice queries:** A variety of SQL exercises, from basic SELECTs to more advanced queries.
- **Learning resource:** A place to experiment, learn, and share SQL knowledge.

## Set Up the Database
- Open your preferred MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or MySQL command line).
- Execute the SQL scripts in `000.sql` to create the `sql_practice` database, define all the tables, and populate them with sample data.

## Database Schema & ER Diagram

The detailed database schema and entity-relationship diagram are now available in [`DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`](DATABASE_SCHEMA.md).  
Please refer to that file for a full description of tables, columns, relationships, and the ER diagram.
